# Hi There, I'm Fessouza!

My name is JoÃ£o V F Souza, but I go by the nickname Fessouza (a combination of the first two letters of Fernandes, one of my last names, with Souza). Currently, I am studying Information Systems at Unesp Bauru, and I started in 2023. I completed my high school education at ETEC (State Technical School) in Bauru, where I obtained a Technical degree in Systems Development. I am really proud to have studied at ETEC because it changed my mindset and gave me a path to start a career in IT. If possible, I would appreciate it if you could go to my repositories and check out my favorite project about color blindness in websites.
